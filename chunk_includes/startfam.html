<h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Please do not judge the content or plausibility of the sentences.</li>
    <br />
    <li>This study is not about rules you find in a grammar book or learn in an English class, but about how language is used in real life.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Imagine that the conversations were taking place between English-speaking friends of yours. Do you think both of the people in the conversation are native speakers (then the conversation is natural)? Or does one of the people sound somehow 'strange'?</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

    Remember, this practice session is only to permit you to become comfortable with the experiment style and technology. These responses are not recorded.
