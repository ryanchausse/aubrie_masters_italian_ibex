  </h1>
  <p>
    You will see a series of conversations taking place on WhatsApp (an app used for texting/messaging).
    <br /><br />
    Select a rating on the scale of 1-7 indicating how <span style="font-weight:bold">natural</span> the conversation seems.
  </p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>These scenarios are fictional. Please do not judge the content or plausibility of the sentences.</li>
    <br />
    <li>There is no 'correct' rating, we are just interested in how natural the dialogues sound to you. This is a study about how language is used in real life.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Imagine that the conversations were taking place between English-speaking friends of yours. Do you think both of the people in the conversation are native speakers (then the conversation is natural)? Or does one of the people sound somehow 'strange'?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Remember, this practice session is only to permit you to become comfortable with the experiment style and technology. These responses are not recorded.
